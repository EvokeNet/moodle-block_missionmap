# Mission Map

The Mission Map block turns course navigation into a fun and playful experience by creating a map with clickable dots - or missions. Each mission takes the user to the corresponding section in the course, but can assume many forms, like side quests, checkpoints or even time bound events. The mission map is automatically built based on a chosen course and can exchange information with the Mission course format.
